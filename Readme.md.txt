# Employee Performance and Attrition Analysis

## Overview
This project explores employee data to understand performance levels and attrition trends in a company. Using SQL queries, I analyzed how different departments are performing and tracked employee departures over time.

## What’s Inside
- **schema.sql** — Creates the employee table structure
- **data.sql** — Sample employee records to work with
- **queries.sql** — SQL queries that calculate average performance by department and count employees who left recently

## Why I Built This
I wanted to practice writing SQL queries on real-world scenarios and build a small project to demonstrate my skills in data analysis and database management.
